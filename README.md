# May-weather

## _This is our frontend group project for DigitalCrafts._

This project will display information regarding the users location of choice including the current temperature, high and low of the day, what it feels like, and the current weather conditions.

We do this by allowing users to choose a geographical location and then present them local weather information utilizng the OpenWeather api.  The user can either choose to share their locaiton, and their city will automatically be displayed, or they can deny and it will default to Washington DC.

Below this there is a carousel that will display the daily weather for the next week from OpenWeather.

The background of the home page will change based on the user's current weather conditions.

There is a radar page that utilizes RainViewer api to display rain and snow (or clouds) in any area.  Can also change the colors of the rain intensity to your preference.

An about us page will explain all about our reveled company: May-Weather.

A contact page allows users to fill out a form and write a message to contact us.

A footer is on every page with our logo, company name, copyright, and links to our email, Instagram, Twitter, and FaceBook

Coming soon - We also will have a seperate page which will showcase the local news of the user's location selection.
